# 147.Insertion Sort List
ðŸ”—https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/

Sort a linked list using insertion sort.


A graphical example of insertion sort. The partial sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list.
With each iteration one element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list
 

* Algorithm of Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.
At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
It repeats until no input elements remain.

* Example 1:

Input: 4->2->1->3

Output: 1->2->3->4

* Example 2:

Input: -1->5->3->4->0

Output: -1->0->3->4->5



# 148. Sort List
ðŸ”—https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/

Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.

* Example 1:

Input: 4->2->1->3

Output: 1->2->3->4

*Example 2:

Input: -1->5->3->4->0

Output: -1->0->3->4->5


# 155. Min Stack
ðŸ”—https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

* push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
* pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
* top() -- Get the top element.
* getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
 

Example:

MinStack minStack = new MinStack();

minStack.push(-2);

minStack.push(0);

minStack.push(-3);

minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.

minStack.pop();

minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.

minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.



# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks
ðŸ”—https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

* push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
* pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
* peek() -- Get the front element.
* empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Example:

MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
